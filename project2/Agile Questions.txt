1. Over the next 30 minutes, I am going to work with Christian to figure out meeting times and try to divide work on the project.
2. I know we can fairly easily divide the code by splitting up the functions themselves.
3. I do not know what the project is supposed to be when it's completely put together, so I'm not sure about the layout exactly.

1. Over the next 30 minutes, I am going to start working on the project and try to develop the first few functions I've assigned for myself.
2. I think I know at least how to implement the DisplayMenu function and ProcessMenuChoice, as well as the logic for IsPosNeg.
3. I don't know exactly how to organize the functions, especially since I don't understand the overall structure of the project.

1. Over the next 30 minutes, I am going to try to figure out the structure of the project before I get too much farther with the functions.
2. I know how to do the functions and I have a better understanding of calling by reference.
3. I am still not sure exactly why or how some of the functions are called by reference, and some of the overall structure of the project.

1. Over the next 30 minutes, I am going to keep working on the structure of the project and how I am going to organize and call the functions.
2. I know how to do all of the functions and how to call by reference.
3. I do not fully understand the details on some of the functions or why they are being called by reference, but I will ask Martha.

1. Over the next 30 minutes, I am going to keep filling out pseudocode.
2. I know how to do pseudocode for all of the functions in the project.
3. I don't know exactly which functions are intended to be call by reference and call by value, because the project doc isn't up to date yet.
